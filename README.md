# DESCRIPTION


This is a grid based pathfinding system that calculates a list of all possible paths from start to target point.


<br />


## How to
1) Open Demo Scene from the Scenes folder
2) Enter play mode
3) Click on any red tiles to make the player move towards the target point

<br />

## Documentation


This system allows only for 4 types of movement: North, South, East and West. However, the base script can be easily modified to include diagonal movements. Several combinations of paths are generated, of which, 1 final path is randomly selected out of all the possible paths
